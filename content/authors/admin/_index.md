I am a 1st year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am broadly interested in
Programming Languages research, and in Program Verification and Synthesis in particular.

I previously graduated from Princeton University with a BA in Computer Science in 2020. 
There I worked with Professor Andrew Appel and Professor Zachary Kincaid. My undergraduate thesis 
was on developing a verified CPS (continuation-passing style) transformation for the 
[CertiCoq](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/certicoq/) compiler.

Outside of work, I enjoy dancing, running and reading.
